# Liquid Investigations Node

Scripts and configuration to run a Liquid Node

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/liquidinvestigations/node.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/liquidinvestigations/node)


## Requirements
Liquid Node requires a Nomad + Consul + Vault cluster where the software will
be deployed. There are a few options:

* [Install a Cluster Manually](#install-a-cluster-manually) - for production or
  barebones development setups
* [Install the Liquid Cluster](#install-the-liquid-cluster) - automated
  single-machine cluster, read the instructions before using in production
* [Use Vagrant](#use-vagrant) - run `vagrant up` and be happy


Whichever option you choose, you will also need to:

* Increase `vm.max_map_count` to at least `262144`, to make elasticsearch
  happy - see the docs about [elasticsearch in docker][] for details.
* Make sure you have Python >= 3.7 installed.

### Install a Cluster Manually
Download Consul, Vault and Nomad. For production environments follow their
manuals. For development run them all in `-dev` mode:

```shell
./consul agent -dev &
./vault agent -dev &
./nomad agent -dev &
```

### Install the Liquid Cluster
[liquidinvestigations/cluster][cluster] is a self-configuring cluster of Consul + Vault + Nomad. It's optimised for local development, testing, and demo/staging servers.

### Use Vagrant
You can run a full Liquid cluster in a local virtual machine using [Vagrant][].
The configuration has been tested with the [libvirt driver][] but should work
with the default VirtualBox driver as well.

1. [Install vagrant][]
2. `cd` to the `vagrant` subfolder, everything Vagrant-related happens in here:
    ```shell
    cd vagrant/
    ```
3. Start the VM:
    ```shell
    vagrant up
    ```

You can log into the vm using `vagrant ssh`. Optionally, install
[vagrant-env][], and set environment variables in an `.env` local file that
will be ignored by git.

Vagrant will forward the following http ports:
  * `guest: 80, host: 1380` - public web server
  * `guest: 8765, host: 18765` - internal web server
  * `guest: 8500, host: 18500` - consul
  * `guest: 8200, host: 18200` - vault
  * `guest: 4646, host: 14646` - nomad

### Vagrant on MacOS

On MacOS the following extra steps need to be taken:

1. Run the following command in a terminal:
```shell
sudo socat -vvv  tcp-listen:80,fork tcp:localhost:1380
```

2. Edit `/etc/hosts` and add the following line:
```text
10.66.60.1       [liquid_domain] hoover.[liquid_domain]
```
where `[liquid_domain]` is the value of `liquid.domain` from the `liquid.ini` file.

## Configuration
The Liquid Investigations cluster configuration is read from `liquid.ini`.
Start with the example configuration file:

```shell
cp examples/liquid.ini .
vim liquid.ini
```

We need a way to access Vault. The simplest way is to use:
```ini
[liquid]
domain = liquid.example.org
debug = true

[cluster]
vault_secrets = /opt/cluster/var/vault-secrets.ini

[collection:testdata]
workers = 1
```

This assumes the `vault-secrets.ini` file exists and contains a vault token. It
will be generated by the `./cluster.py autovault` command, or you can create it
manually in a different location with the following contents:

```ini
[vault]
root_token = s.Cmro41vNI4wIndgrPqzlqOKY
```

Then deploy to the cluster:

```shell
./liquid deploy
```

The liquid instance will listen by default on port 80 on the local machine. If
you don't have a DNS domain pointing to the macine, you can add entries to
`/etc/hosts`:

```
10.0.0.1 liquid.example.com
10.0.0.1 hoover.liquid.example.com
...
```

Create an initial admin user:
```shell
./liquid shell liquid-core ./manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Versions
The liquid bundle comes with a `versions.ini` file with a known set of working
versions. You can override them in `liquid.ini`, see `examples/liquid.ini` for
more information.

### Testdata
Set up the `testdata` collection. First download the data:

```shell
mkdir -p collections
git clone https://github.com/hoover/testdata collections/testdata
```

Next define the collection in `liquid.ini`:

```ini
[collection:testdata]
workers = 1
```

Then let the `deploy` command pick up the new collection:

```shell
./liquid deploy
```

### Nextcloud

Nextcloud runs on the subdomain nextcloud.<liquid_domain>

### Rocket.Chat

In order to activate liquid login, follow [RocketChatAuthSetup](docs/RocketChatAuthSetup.md).

### Importing collections from docker-setup

#### Preparation

The node setup must be clean. For this, either use a new node install (recommended), or remove
all collections from `liquid.ini` and run the following commands:
```shell
./liquid purge
./liquid halt
rm -fr ./volumes/hoover
```

#### Import

In order to import the collections from `docker-setup` run the following command:
```shell
./liquid importfromdockersetup [path_to_docker_setup] [method]
```

The `method` is optional. The default value is `link`, while the possible values are:
- `link`: create links to existing directories in `docker-setup`
- `copy`: copy the data from `docker-setup` to `node`
- `move`: move the directories from `docker-setup` to `node`

When using the `copy` method, the import will take longer.

### Debugging

Set the debug flag in `liquid.ini`:
```ini
[liquid]
debug = on
```

Then redeploy (`./liquid deploy`).

To log into the snoop docker container for testdata:
```shell
./liquid shell snoop-testdata-api
```

To dump the nginx configuration:
```shell
nomad alloc fs $(./liquid alloc liquid nginx) nginx/local/core.conf
```

#### Working on components

In order to work on Hoover Search, Hoover Snoop, or Liquid Core, first clone the repositories:
```shell
cd repos
./clone.sh https  # or ./clone.sh ssh, based on preference
```

After that, set this flag in your configuration:

```ini
[liquid]
...
mount_local_repos = true
```

#### Running custom jobs
You can deploy your own jobs on the cluster. First, create a nomad job file,
you can use one of the existing `.nomad` files as a starting point. Save it in
the `local` folder, or outside the repository, so that it doesn't interfere
with updates. Then add the job to `liquid.ini`:

```ini
[job:foo]
template = local/foo.nomad
```

Afterwards, run `./liquid deploy`, which will send your job `foo` to nomad.
