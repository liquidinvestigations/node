- [x] add minio to deps
- [x] add minio to all snoop containers
- [x] run split workers
- [x] use pgpool-II to proxy snoop worker DB connections to 1 per collection: https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/pgpool/
- [ ] add blob buckets to backup/restore

FUTURE:
- [ ] automatically calculate worker count & distribuiton
  - fetch CPU and RAM avail from Nomad
  - method to compute weights of each worker queue for current collection
  - publish some fair guess defaults for worker weights to use as defaults
  - compute # of processes for each container
  - compute # of containers for each worker queue
