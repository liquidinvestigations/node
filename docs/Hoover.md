# Hoover in the Liquid bundle

The Liquid Investigations bundle includes Hoover ([hoover-search][],
[hoover-snoop][], [hoover-ui][]). It's pre-configured with a collection named
`uploads` that is visible in [Nextcloud][] and indexed periodically by snoop.

[hoover-search]: https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/hoover-search
[hoover-snoop]: https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/hoover-snoop2
[hoover-ui]: https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/hoover-ui
[Nextcloud]: ./Nextcloud.md

## Example: Testdata
Set up the `testdata` collection. First download the data:

```shell
mkdir -p collections
git clone https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/testdata collections/testdata
```

Next define the collection in `liquid.ini`:

```ini
[collection:testdata]
process = True
```

Then let the `deploy` command pick up the new collection:

```shell
./liquid deploy
```

## Adding collections

All collections are loaded from the `liquid_collections` directory configured in `liquid.ini`.
The directories directly under `liquid_collections` can NOT be symlinks, since the docker container must access the data even if it's symlinked outside of the mounted directory. Instead of symlinks, use bind mounts or nfs mounts.

To add new collections simply append to the `liquid.ini` file:

```ini
[collection:always-changes]
process = True
sync = True

[collection:static-data]
process = True
```

... and run `./liquid deploy`. The requested number of workers and their dependencies will be deployed on the Nomad cluster; see them run on the Nomad UI.

---

The two parameters control:
- `process`: on/off switch for processing this collection, defaults to False.
- `sync`: wether the workers should track the collection data and re-process changed/new documents

The collection names must follow the [elasticsearch index naming guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/indices-create-index.html#indices-create-index), namely **lowercase alphanumeric**, **dashes** and **numbers** only.


## Removing collections

In order to remove a collection, take the following steps:
1. Remove the corresponding collection section from the `liquid.ini` file.
2. Run `./liquid deploy`
3. Run `./liquid shell hoover:snoop ./manage.py purge` -- use optional argument `--force` to skip manual confirmation.


## OCR


### Integrated Tesseract OCR

Use the collection's `ocr_languages` config value to set any number of
languages for [tesseract 4.0
LSTM](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Data-Files#data-files-for-version-400-november-29-2016).


After changing the `ocr_languages` setting for an already processed collection, please run:

     ./liquid dockerexec hoover-workers:snoop-workers ./manage.py retrytasks COLLECTION -- --func digests.launch

### External OCR

Some datasets might come with OCR already processed. Hoover can import both TXT and PDF outputs from external OCR.
Multiple batches or versions of OCR data may exist, so each OCR source is identified by a name, written in this section as `SOURCE_NAME`.

Place your OCR outputs under the directory `collections/COLLECTION/ocr/SOURCE_NAME` (as opposed to `collections/COLLECTION/data` where the original data is).
The `SOURCE_NAME` will be the identifier for your external OCR source.

The OCR outputs:
- can be placed at any depth inside the `collections/COLLECTION/ocr/SOURCE_NAME` directory, 
- **must** have its filename start with the document MD5 and end with either `.pdf` or `.txt` extensions

After writing the OCR outputs into a new OCR_SOURCE, run the following commands:

```
./liquid dockerexec hoover:snoop ./manage.py createocrsource COLLECTION SOURCE
./liquid dockerexec hoover:snoop ./manage.py retrytasks COLLECTION --func ocr.walk_source
```

After adding files to an existing OCR source, you can re-walk the source directory by running the line:

```
./liquid dockerexec hoover:snoop ./manage.py retrytasks COLLECTION --func ocr.walk_source
```

This command will automatically re-process the collection documents to include the new external OCR data.


#### An example with testdata

You can test out this feature on the testdata collection. Take a look at the [file structure here](https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/hoover-testdata/tree/master/ocr/). After cloning and configuring testdata as instructed in `liquid.ini`, run these commands:

```
./liquid dockerexec hoover:snoop ./manage.py createocrsource testdata one
./liquid dockerexec hoover:snoop ./manage.py createocrsource testdata two
./liquid dockerexec hoover:snoop ./manage.py retrytasks testdata --func ocr.walk_source
```

And verify that they exist under the results for document with MD5 = `fd41b8f1fe19c151517b3cda2a615fa8` by searching the `testdata` collection with the query `md5:fd41b8f1fe19c151517b3cda2a615fa8`. You should see OCR versions for `one`, `two` as well as any Tesseract languages configured for the collection:

## Re-processing and adding new data

You can trigger a manual re-walk of all directories (to find new and changed data) with:

```
./liquid dockerexec hoover:snoop ./manage.py retrytasks testdata --func filesystem.walk
```

You can trigger a manual retry for failed tasks with:

```
./liquid dockerexec hoover:snoop ./manage.py retrytasks testdata --status error --status broken
```
