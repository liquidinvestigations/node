# RocketChat OAuth2 with Liquid Core

Rocket.Chat can directly authenticate users with the `liquid-core` oauth2
server. Most of the configuration is automated, but there is one manual step
that needs to be performed by an administrator through Rocket.Chat's web admin.

1. Get the Rocket.Chat admin credentials:
    ```shell
    ./liquid getsecret liquid/rocketchat/adminuser
    ```

2. Log into Rocket.Chat - `http(s)://rocketchat.<liquid_domain>` - using those
   credentials.

4. Create custom oauth application and call it `Liquid`

5. Log out. On the login page, a new button, "Liquid Login", should appear.
   Click on it and go through the `liquid-core` login process. It should
   redirect back to Rocket.Chat and authenticate.

6. On first login, you are presented with a question, to choose a username.
   It's currently not based on the liquid username, so please enter something
   that people will recognize.
