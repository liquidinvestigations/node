  size, using up all available disk space on the `/` partition. The workaround
  without this fix is to simply "stop" the Tika containers from Nomad UI every

--------------

## Version 0.14.5 (2021-05-05)

This is a Hoover UI hotfix release that brings more stability when searching in
a large number of collections. This is done by splitting aggregation search
requests into smaller ones, and by retrying timed out and failed requests.


### Improvements

- Added configuration option called `hoover_ui_agg_split` for splitting aggregations into consecutive requests.
- Added configuration option called `hoover_ui_search_retry` for maximum number of retries allowed for failed search requests. See the [example config file](https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/node/blob/v0.14.5/examples/liquid.ini) for more details.

[CodiMD](https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/docs/wiki/User-Guide%3A-CodiMD),
[Nextcloud](https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/docs/wiki/User-Guide%3A-Nextcloud),
and
[Hypothesis](https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/docs/wiki/User-Guide%3A-Hypothesis).

- When clicking on a PDF document, the UI jumps by default to its OCR PDF preview tab, so you can annotate the scans. The texts for the document are available below on the same tab.
- Mention collection in search result card.
- After selecting a collection, Hoover will now pull all the aggregation buckets, even if you didn't fill in a query yet.
- Added more progress spinner UI components for better interaction on slow servers.

### Bug Fixes

#### Hoover

- Fixed bug where Hoover PDF OCR preview would display an error for longer PDFs.
- Fixed bug where Hoover annotation tooltip info would display a negative number "Indexed -5 seconds ago" after clicking on lock.
- Removed Hoover Admin buttons for unsupported actions: adding/removing users and collections. User management is done in the home page, and collection management is done through the `liuqid.ini` configuration file.
- Fixed buttons for deleting a selected filter from the filter preview bubble.


#### Hypothesis

- Removed links from Hypothesis sidebar to facebook, twitter, google plus, `mailto:` to prevent accidental leaking. The icons currently still exist but error out with 404 on our page.

#### Rocketchat

- Replaced the `go.rocket.chat` channel invite URLs with our own rocketchat page to prevent accidental leaking. The links will now error out with 404 on our page.

### Upgrade Notes

We have upgraded Hoover's database to the latest version, and that means a dump/restore is needed as part of this deployment. The dump/restore won't be bigger than 500 MB, and won't take more than 5min.

- create full app backup before upgrading: `./liquid backup TMP_BACKUP --no-collections`
- follow ["clean reset" procedure](https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/docs/wiki/Maintenance#clean-reset) with [cluster version 0.13.1](https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/cluster/tree/v0.13.1)
- restore app backup after deploy is done: `./liquid restore-apps TMP_BACKUP`
- verify that Hoover groups and permissions are still correct by visiting Hoover Admin
- delete the backup: `rm -rf TMP_BACKUP`
